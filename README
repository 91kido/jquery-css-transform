This Monkey Patch for jQuery 1.3.1+ allows you to set and get CSS Transforms
in Webkit/Safari and Firefox 3.1+ in a uniform way with the jQuery css()
method.  You can simply do the following rather than using browser specific
properties:

$('#example').css('transform', 'rotate(165deg)');

Include the JavaScript code in jquery-css-transform.js in your project after
loading jQuery.

This code is currently available for use in all personal or commercial projects
under both MIT and GPL licenses, just like jQuery.

Change Log
-----------------------------

2009.05.24 - Updated to usual jQuery patch/plugin pattern where jQuery is passed in as $ argument.
           - Monkey Patched call to css() really only needed key as a named argument.
           - Neither of these updates really change anything.  Mostly just code cleanliness issues.

2009.02.23 - Added to GitHub.
